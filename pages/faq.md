Our mission is to provide a safe and welcoming space for New Yorkers to gather and enjoy [NYC Open Streets](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml) on Grand Street this summer. 

## What is the significance of the Flower in the Logo?
The flower represents the [Callery Pear Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrus_calleryana) flower that blooms every spring. The flower is an iconic symbol of our [corner of Williamsburg](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/tree/1054003) as Callery Pear Trees line Havemeyer street from Grand to Metropolitan. The tree symbolizes sustenance, generosity, and longevity. It is tolerant of change and can withstand pollution. It provides shade and attracts beautiful song birds.
